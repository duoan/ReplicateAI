## 🎯 Reproduction Objectives

- Implement the model from the paper in a modular, transparent way.
- Replicate key experiments and results.
- Verify main claims and discuss deviations.
- Document issues, reproducibility challenges, and results.

## 🧩 Core Ideas

1. Masked Language Model (MLM), not like the left-to-right language model pre-training. fuse the left and right context.
    1. This allow pre-train a deep bidirectional Transformer.
    2. Next sentence prediction task
2. Unified architecture across different tasks.
3. Multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder
4. WordPiece embedding with 30,000 token vocabulary is used
    1. First token of every sequence is always a special token classification token `[CLS]`
5. Mask some percentage (15%) of the input tokens at random, and then predict those masked tokens.
